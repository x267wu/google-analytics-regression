Question 1:

Assumptions: 
- A session lasting more than 1 hour will be counted in two hours, since that session is still active, and would be unique to that 
  hour. Same goes for unique visitors, they are counted once per hour in which they had events. 
- The count of unique events includes page views, since we are equating hits = events in the problem set description until question 2.

Query:

SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT CONCAT(fullVisitorID, ',',visitId)) AS number_of_unique_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorID) AS number_of_unique_users,
  COUNT(1) AS number_of_unique_events,
  hour
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_20170801`,
  UNNEST(hits) AS hits
GROUP BY
  hour
ORDER BY
  hour;

Results:

Question 2:

Assumptions:
- By 'Promotion Click' I am assuming you are referring to 'Onsite Click', since "select distinct(hits.eventInfo.eventAction)" 
  does not return 'Promotion Click' at all in the entire dataset accross all tables. 'Onsite Click' also seems like an important user-action to track.
  Going with my gut here that this is a mistake in the requirements. The only part of the dataset indicating promo clicks is promotionActionInfo.promoIsClick,
  which will already be counted since its attached to user actions. 

- also assuming that there is a ${escCatTitle} product category and that I do not need to trim the directory path strings down to the leaf.

Query:

SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorId) AS number_of_unique_users_with_actions,
  v2ProductCategory
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_20170801`,
  UNNEST(hits) AS hits,
  UNNEST(hits.product) AS product
WHERE
  hits.type != 'PAGE'
  AND hits.eventInfo.eventAction IN ('Onsite Click',
    'Product Click',
    'Quickview Click')
GROUP BY
  v2ProductCategory
ORDER BY
  number_of_unique_users_with_actions DESC;

Question 3:

Assumptions:

- There is one unique row per session (I verified that with a group by statement around visitId and fullVisitorId)
- We only want the breakdown for sessions with Add to Cart actions. Those without are not included in the breakdown below.

Query:

SELECT
  COUNTIF(totals.transactions > 0) AS number_of_sessions_with_purchases,
  COUNTIF(totals.transactions IS NULL) AS number_of_abandoned_carts
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_20170801`
WHERE
  'Add to Cart' IN UNNEST(hits.eventInfo.eventAction);

Results:

number_of_sessions_with_purchases	number_of_abandoned_carts
34					142

Question 4:

Assumptions:

-- the hits.hour field represents the hour in which the hit occured in the customer's timezone.
-- promoIsClick means that a promotion was clicked (ad/link with a discount/deal)

Query:

SELECT
  -- IN returns null instead of False since totals.transactions contains null values
  ('Remove from Cart' IN UNNEST(hits.eventInfo.eventAction)) IS NOT NULL AS has_remove_from_cart,
  (totals.transactions > 0) IS NOT NULL AS is_purchase,
  geoNetwork.continent,
  totals.newVisits IS NOT NULL AS is_new_visit,
  device.isMobile,
  (
  SELECT
    hour
  FROM
    UNNEST(hits)
  WHERE
    eventInfo.eventAction = 'Add to Cart'
  ORDER BY
    hitNumber DESC
  LIMIT
    1) AS last_add_to_cart_hour,
  totals.hits -
IF
  (totals.pageviews IS NOT NULL,
    totals.pageviews,
    0) AS number_of_user_actions,
IF
  (totals.pageviews IS NOT NULL,
    totals.pageviews,
    0) AS number_of_page_views,

    totals.timeOnSite,

  (TRUE IN UNNEST(hits.promotionActionInfo.promoIsClick)) IS NOT NULL AS has_promo,
  (
  SELECT
    MIN(time)/1000

    UNNEST(hits)
  WHERE
    eventInfo.eventAction = 'Add to Cart') AS first_add_to_cart_delay,
  (

    UNNEST(hits)
  WHERE
    eventInfo.eventAction = 'Quickview Click'
    AND type='EVENT') AS quick_click_count,
  (
  SELECT
    COUNT(*)
  FROM
    UNNEST(hits)
  WHERE
    eventInfo.eventAction = 'Onsite Click'
    AND type='EVENT') AS onsite_click_count,
  (
  SELECT
    COUNT(*)
  FROM
    UNNEST(hits)
  WHERE
    eventInfo.eventAction = 'Product Click'
    AND type='EVENT') AS product_click_count,
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_*`
WHERE
  'Add to Cart' IN UNNEST(hits.eventInfo.eventAction);

--this query could've be done cleaner with cross joins and group bys

Reasoning:

has_remove_from_cart: might show that a user is more serious about buying an item, since that would mean they are looking at the price (you do not need to remove your items
                      from the cart if you are not planning to make a purchase.
is_purchase: The target class.
continent: Chose this categorical variable because the dataset might be too small to have 150~ country categories one-hot-encoded (occam's razor). There might be a correlation between continent
           and purchase, as the average income is different in each part of the world.
is_new_visit: The fact that someone is visiting the website for the first time might be negatively correlated to making a purchase.
isMobile: I am reasoning that the purchase experience on a phone versus a desktop would impact the chances of making a purchase (I get frustrated on my phone trying to type my credit card in)
last_add_to_cart_hour: From the first question, I saw some patterns where people were more active during daytime. Im hoping this would translate well to predicting purchases.
number_of_user_actions: More activity in a session should be positevely correlated to the probability of a purchase.
has_promo: If a user clicked on a promo, the deal should usually entice them to purchase more often than not.
first_add_to_cart_delay: how long it takes before an add to cart action is made might say something about the "conviction" to make a purchase of the user
add_to_cart_count, quick_click_count, onsite_click_count, product_click_count :just throwing stuff at the wall and seeing if it sticks or not, but any user action should in theory indicate something
                                                                               about the willingess of purchase.
